If you are a Linux user, first create a Dropbox account and download the dbxcli release for your system from "https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli", renaming it or creating a symbolic link named "antoniovandre_dbxcli". Install the app on your Dropbox account and create a directory in the root called "antoniovandre_mathgame" so that the logs can be saved online.

If you are not a Linux or Android user, you can install a BASH shell on your operating system.

The processing of the statistics can be time consuming, so you can play with the command "bash antoniovandre_mathgame ne", where only the log file will be saved, and, when not using the device, execute "bash antoniovandre_mathgame oe" to only process the statistics.

If you have problems with sounds in the system, set to "0" the variables "SOUND" in the executable and "SOM" in "antoniovandre_echo" and "antoniovandre_echo_android".

There are many other options avaliable when editing fonts.

The shell can make mistakes, in which case I am exempt from liability.
